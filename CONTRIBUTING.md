## Getting Started

### Running the app locally

0. Install Ruby (RVM / Rbenv or another Ruby version manager is ideal for easy version updates)
0. Install Bundler (`gem install bundler`) and foreman (`gem install foreman`)
0. Install Postgres and make sure postgres/bin is on your $PATH.
0. Start postgres if it isn't automatically running: `postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres`
0. Install Elasticsearch and make sure it is running.
0. Install Redis and make sure it is running.
0. Install the [Qt implementation of Webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit) as we now depend on [capybara-webkit gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit).
0. Run `./bin/setup` to initialize the rails application and install the
   necessary dependencies.
0. Edit the environment-specific variables in a `.env`.
   Test-specific variables can go in `.env.test`.
   Default database configuration is stored in `config/database.yml`.
0. Add the CROMERR account credentials (CDX_USERNAME and CDX_PASSWORD) to `.env`.
0. Run `rake secret` and set the output as the value for `SECRET_KEY_BASE` in `.env`.
0. Run `foreman start` to start the Rails application.
0. Go to `http://localhost:5000` and enjoy!

### Development practices

* Everything that's in the "Current" column in
  [Trello](https://trello.com/b/0geMlbgF/epa-emanifest) is fair game.
* When you start work on a task, move it to "Work In Progress" and self-assign.
* Create a branch off of master for each feature and open a pull request when
  development on that feature is ready to be reviewed.
* Once it's ready for review, move the card to "Ready for Review" in Trello
* Assign pull requests you are reviewing to yourself so others know that you are
  reviewing.
* A pull request must receive a thumbs up from at least one person other than
  the author before it can be merged.
* The pull request reviewer merges the pull request when it is ready.
* The merger should also push the updated master branch to production.
* When a feature is reviewed/merged and pushed to production (our only integration
  server) where the client/product owner can verify, move the card to
  "pending acceptance"

### One-off Tasks

- To add dummy data for developing against, run `rake populate:manifests RANDOMIZE_CREATED_AT=true`.
- To (re)build the Elasticsearch index, run `rake search:index FORCE=y`.
- Run `bundle update` to grab any updated gems.
- To update the database schema, run `rake db:migrate`. For test you will need to preface with env variables to indicate the environment: RACK_ENV=test rake db:migrate

### Running Tests

Server tests are in rspec. Just run `rspec`.

### Deploying to cloud.gov

* To deploy to *e-manifest.18f.gov*: `cf target -o epa-emanifest -s prod && script/deploy e-manifest`
* To deploy to *e-manifest-dev.18f.gov*: `cf target -o epa-emanifest -s dev && script/deploy e-manifest-dev`

## CROMERR Signing

We submit and sign manifest data to another API known as CDX.

The signing process generally goes under the pseudo-trade name of CROMERR (or
CROMERR-compliant), so youâ€™ll hear both terms in regards to the third party API
we use.

In order to access the development CDX system for CROMERR signing of a manifest,
one needs a system account set up with rights to sign on behalf of authenticated
users. The account credentials are available from the e-Manifest development
team.

The username and password env variables should be in the `.env` file
located in the root with the following form:

    CDX_USERNAME = "put username here"
    CDX_PASSWORD = "put password here"

In addition to these API keys, you will need the username, password, and
security question answers in order to sign in via the web UI. These can also be
obtained via team members.
