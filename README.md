# The e-Manifest App for EPA

Visit [18F Consulting](https://pages.18f.gov/consulting/projects/epa/e-manifest/) for details about this project.

This is a Ruby/Sinatra app, with a Jekyll static site in the `_static` directory. The Jekyll site will be generated in the `public/` directory, which Sinatra routes to automatically.

Don't edit the `public/` folder directly! Jekyll will overwrite everything when building the site.

## Running Locally

1. Install Ruby
2. Install Bundler (`gem install bundler`) 
3. Install Postgres and make sure postgres/bin is on your $PATH.
4. Create an `emanifest` database in your postgres instance.
5. Run `bundle install` to grab the required gems.
6. Run `rake serve`. This will build the Jekyll site and start the Sinatra server. If you have set a postgres username and password, try this: `DATABASE_URL=postgres://<postgres user>:<password>@localhost/emanifest rake serve` or configure the DATABASE_URL environment variable as you see fit.
7. Go to `localhost:9292` and enjoy!
