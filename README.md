# The e-Manifest App for EPA

This is a Ruby/Sinatra/Angular app, with a Jekyll static site in the `_static` directory. The Jekyll site will be generated in the `public/` directory, which Sinatra routes to automatically.

Don't edit the `public/` folder directly! Jekyll will overwrite everything when building the site.
