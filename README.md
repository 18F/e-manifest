# The e-Manifest App for EPA

Visit [18F Consulting](https://pages.18f.gov/consulting/projects/epa/e-manifest/) for details about this project, or check out our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/0geMlbgF/epa-emanifest) to see what we're working on right now.

This is a Ruby/Sinatra/Angular app, with a Jekyll static site in the `_static` directory. The Jekyll site will be generated in the `public/` directory, which Sinatra routes to automatically.

Don't edit the `public/` folder directly! Jekyll will overwrite everything when building the site.

## Running Locally

0. Copy the secret.rb.template to secret.rb. See below CROMERR Signing
0. Install Ruby
0. Install Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
0. Install Postgres and make sure postgres/bin is on your $PATH.
0. Install Elasticsearch and make sure it is running.
0. Install Redis and make sure it is running.
0. Start postgres if it isn't automatically running: `postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres`
0. Run `bundle install` to grab the required gems.
0. Use `rake db:create:all` to create the databases.
0. User `rake db:migrate` to transform the database structure to what is
   needed by the app. For test you will need to preface with env variables 
   to indicate the environment: `RACK_ENV=test rake db:migrate`
0. Place environment-specific variables in a `.env.`*environmentname* file. The default is `.env`.
   Test-specific variables can go in `.env.test`. If you have set a postgres username and password,
   use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to configure it. See `.env.example` for an example.
   Default database configuration is stored in `config/database.yml`.
0. Run `rake serve`. This will build the Jekyll site and start the Sinatra server.
0. Go to `localhost:9292` and enjoy!

## Rake Tasks

- To build the static site, run `rake build`.
- To build and serve the app, run `rake serve`.
- To deploy to 18F's cloud, run `rake deploy`.
- To add dummy data for developing against, run `rake populate:manifests`.
- To (re)build the Elasticsearch index, run `rake search:index`.

To add analytics support needed for production, prepend `JEKYLL_ENV=production` to any of the above commands.

## Running Tests
Server tests are in rspec. Just run `rspec`.

Client tests use karma/mocha/chai:

- [Install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/stable/)
- `npm install`
- `npm test`


## CROMERR Signing

In order to access the development CDX system for CROMERR signing of a manifest, one needs a system account set up with rights to sign on behalf of authenticated users. The account credentials are available from the e-Manifest development team.

The username and password should be placed in a `secret.rb` file located in the root with the following form:

	$cdx_username = "put username here"
	$cdx_password = "put password here"

In other words, `cp secret.rb.template secret.rb` and edit the file.
