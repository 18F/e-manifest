## Application architecture

This is a Rails application with a Postgres database. The app contains both API
endpoints and web views. The API is a JSON REST API. The web app and the API
use the same database.

Elasticsearch is used to search for manifest records. Elasticsearch offloads
read-access from the database and provides full-text search that can be painful
to apply directly to a database

Redis is being used for Sidekiq job processing. The Redis + Sidekiq solution
offloads the database/Elasticsearch syncing to an async process.
